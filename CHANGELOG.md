  - Civilian casualty punishment
  - Equipment blacklist/whitelist + loadout randomisation
  - Zade BOC

---

### 20/09/2023
New:
- Added a function to generate ammo boxes from player loadouts, `TFD_fnc_generateSupplies`.
  - Can be used from the editor by selecting ammo boxes/vehicles, then executing `[get3denSelected "object"] call TFD_fnc_generateSupplies;`.

### 10/09/2023
Changed:
- Update service aircraft script to only activate when the aircraft is stopped and has the engine turned off.

- `TFD_fnc_ServiceJet` has been renamed to `TFD_fnc_serviceAircraft` and should now work for ALL air vehicles, not just jets.
- Garrison functions now generate groups of maximum size 8, when group size is exceeded a new group is created instead of having the entire garrison in one group.

---

### 23/04/2021

- Adjusted ACE view distance settings slightly:
  - Increased maximum view distance cap from 3km to 5km.
  - Default infantry view distance changed to 1.5km.
  - Default land vehicle view distance changed to 2km.
  - Default air vehicle view distance changed to 4km.
  - All infantry, land and air view distances are **NOT** forced, so client settings will override these allowing players to change the view distances to suit their hardware/preference if desired. (Still cannot exceed 5km view distance cap)

---

### 14/03/2021
- Implemented a new auto-assign radio system to avoid the need to manually configure radio assignment in loadouts.
  - This will be enabled by default on new missions using this version of the framework, but can be disabled if you would rather manually add the radios.
  - Radios can be assigned to groups, individual units or squad leaders. See latest `init.sqf` for an example.
- Consolidated all radio related configuration into `init.sqf` to avoid the need to dig through the function folders to setup radios and for ease of configuration.
- Renamed `civpunish` function folder to `civilian` and added new function: `TFD_fnc_customCiv`
  - Can be executed on a civilian unit to randomise their equipment and identity to suit your mission setting, i.e. africa, vietnam, etc
  - Place `[_this] spawn TFD_fnc_customCiv;` in 'Code On Unit Created' box in Civilian Presence module.
  - Custom equipment/face/voice classnames can be added in `functions/civilian/fn_customCiv.sqf`.
- Fixed `fn_civPunish`, now works with Civilian Presence module, also fixed some typos in the civpunish files.
- Added new `fn_unitVariation` function fired from `playerSetup.sqf` which allows you to define helmets/facewear/faces/voices to assign randomly to players on mission start to add a bit of variety without having to manually edit all the loadouts. Units can be blacklisted to avoid this behaviour.
- Added some new QOL functions to help speed up mission editing process:
  - New function `TFD_fnc_generateORBAT`, will allow you to generate a fully formatted copy-paste friendly TFD_ORBAT array, assuming the groups are named correctly and all have 's_n' names assigned. I recommend doing this LAST after you have set up the order of the units in the role list.
  - To use, start the mission in *SINGLEPLAYER* and open the debug console, then execute `[] call TFD_fnc_generateOrbat;`. Then simply use CTRL+V to paste the result into an empty text document.
  - New function `TFD_fnc_getEquipmentClasses`, will allow you to retrieve various equipment classnames from a set of units provided as a paramater. This complements the new unit variation and custom civ functions quite nicely and makes it easier to get weapon classes for Diwako's Punish Unknown Weapon script.
  - To use, start the mission in *SINGLEPLAYER* and open the debug console, then execute `[switchableUnits] call TFD_fnc_getEquipmentClasses;` and paste the result into an empty text file. You can also pass other arrays of units into it if you wanted, such as a group, e.g. `[units yourGroup] call TFD_fnc_getEquipmentClasses;` will get all the classnames from all the units in group 'yourGroup'.

---

### 03/03/2021
- Tweaked adminpanel functions & `fn_setRadio` to automatically execute on mission start without requiring a manual call in the init scripts.
  - Edit settings in `fn_setRadio` to disable SR, mission start hint or enable custom labels (was previously in `init.sqf`).
- Fixed a typo in `fn_assignChannels`.
- Converted grenade stop to ACE compatible version (did this a while ago but must have forgotten to add it to framework).
- Added `_uptakeIntensity` parameter to `fn_tm4_fuelUptake` to allow easier configuration of fuel drain speed.
- Minor comment/spacer cleanups.

---

### 26/01/2021

  - Tidied up TP instruction box. Teleport key combinations are now in the tooltip instead of the text box.
  - The selected unit's group is now highlighted white on the map display with the leader being highlighted yellow, to allow quick identification of group leader (useful for teleporting JIP players to relevant squad.
  - Unconscious units will now be marked red on the map display. The priority for marker colour is Unconscious > Selected unit group > Side.

---

### 19/01/2021
- Updated TFD admin panel.
  - Added various new information panels to show selected player's info and medical status.
  - Most controls now affect the selected player not just the player currently using the admin panel.

  - Players are now visible/tracked on the map display and can be selected by clicking on the display.
  - End mission button now supports custom endings defined in CfgDebriefing.
  - Now works in spectator so dead admins can now use the admin panel if necessary (can be a bit buggy).
  - Teleport can now be done just by clicking on the map using modifier keys such as SHIFT/CTRL/ALT.
  - Attempting to teleport to a player in a vehicle will put you into the vehicle if there is room, or near the vehicle if no seats are available.
  - UIDs can be added to the authorised ID list mid mission if necessary, will possibly add a button for this in future update.

---

### 11/01/2021
- Fixed T1 Artillery settings:
  - By default NATO SL units ("B_Soldier_SL_F") and the commander unit (s_1) are authorised to use T1 Artillery.

- Fixed civpunish function kill message not showing up in dedicated environment.

---

### 26/11/2020
- Re-implemented VoN fix. (now working)
- Tweaked Diwako Punish Weapon settings again:
  - Nerfed jam chance and disperion add significantly.
  - Weapons are now semi-usable for the first couple magazines (or first box for mgs) but get worse and worse before becoming effectively unusable within 3-4 mags (120 shots).
  - This allows players to use enemy weapons in a pinch if they run out of ammo but makes the weapon useless fairly quickly.

---

### 14/11/2020
- Removed view distance settings from `initServer.sqf` and `initPlayerLocal.sqf`. (Controlled by CBA settings)
- Moved some Diwako Punish Weapon stuff from `init.sqf` to it's own function to tidy up a bit.

- Changed ACE litter/blood amounts and cleanup back to what they were before experimental merge (was accidentally overwritten).
- Set 'ace_medical_treatment_allowSharedEquipment' to 1 so medics will now use their own supplies by default when treating a patient instead of using the patient's supplies first.

---

### 19/08/2020
- Added README files into `!ADDITIONAL_SCRIPTS` folder to explain what it's for and as a reminder to delete it before exporting mission file.
- Added code formatting to file names in `README.md` for readability.
- Added instructions on GitHub page on how to import mission framework.
- Added line to `playerSetup.sqf` to holster player's weapon when spawning.
- Rebalanced Diwako Punish Unknown Weapon settings:
  - Weapons fail frequently enough to be annoying but not completely useless.
  - Dispersion setting lowered to allow better accuracy at close range but still high enough to make it difficult to hit targets 150+ metres away. (Makes it more dangerous for players using unknown weapons since they have to get closer to be effective).
  - New defaults are: 7% jam chance, 22% reload fail chance, +30 dispersion.
- Fixed ACE Advanced Bandages setting being set to 'false' instead of a value on the range 0-2. Now set to 0 (disabled).

---

### 01/08/2020
- Added header files containing classnames for NATO M4 style ARs and Russian AK style ARs that can be enabled using the Diwako Punish Unknown Weapon whitelist located in `init.sqf`.
  - If enabled will allow players to use all M4/AK style rifles without being punished.
  - To be extra certain, you should still define the weapons used by players in your mission manually, no duplicates will be created.
  - *Should* only include AR weapons. Marksman rifles, lmgs, launchers, etc all still need to be added manually if you want players to be able to use them without penalty.
- Tweaked Punish Unknown Weapon settings to be slightly more forgiving.
- Fixed duplicate case in `DAC_Config_Units.sqf`.
- Added comments to `cba_settings.sqf` explaining the ACE Fatigue settings.

---

### 31/07/2020
- Moved Diwako Punish Unknown Weapon whitelist from `initPlayerLocal.sqf` to `init.sqf` (local whitelist should now work correctly)

---

### 26/07/2020
- Disabled ACE Advanced Fatigue by default.
- Forced Advanced Fatigue settings in `cba_settings.sqf` so they correctly overwrite the server settings.

---

### 24/07/2020
- Fixed Diwako Punish Unknown Weapon local whitelist in `initPlayerLocal.sqf`. The script requires the uppercase form of the weapon classname.
- Touched up a few comments from various functions.
- Added comments to `fn_customDifficulty.sqf` to help explain what each setting changes.

---

### 10/07/2020
- Updated DAC config files.

---

### 07/07/2020

- Redesigned Timid's garrison script:
  - Now allows custom loadouts for units.
  - Units can move around and reposition instead of being locked in place (can be disabled).
  - Caches units that are far from players.
  - Markers and triggers can both be used to mark garrison zones now as well.
- Added forceUniform function fired from `playerSetup.sqf`:
  - This allows mission makers to force uniform/headgear/vest on players to prevent them from picking up uniforms and headgear they aren't supposed to have.
  - Units added to the whitelist will not have uniform forced on them, even if it is enabled.
