Place 'dac' folder into main mission file directory and uncomment marked lines in 'init.sqf' to use.

For an example setup, create a new blank mission, save and exit the editor, then overwrite the mission.sqm file with the
one in this folder. When you reopen the mission file in the editor you should now open the new mission.sqm.
