## Importing the editor compositions
1. Open your Arma 3 profile and navigate to the `compositions` folder. It should be located at:
   ```
   C:\Users\<YOUR_USER>\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\<YOUR_PROFILE>\compositions\
   ```
   > [!TIP]  
   > An easy way to get to this folder is to open your mission folder then go back up 2 levels, as your `missions` and `mpmissions` folders are also located in your profile.

2. Copy all the folders from inside the `!TFD_Compositions` folder into your `compositions` folder.
   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > If you have the mission editor open when you do this step, the compositions will not show up. Opening another mission file or closing the editor and reopening it should refresh the compositions list.

**You will have to repeat this process if the compositions are updated and you want to use the updated version.**
